## What is difPy for Desktop?

difPy for Desktop brings difPy’s image deduplication capabilities as an intuitive, easy to use app to your desktop.

Unlike most deduplication software, difPy does **not** compare images based on their hashes - it compares them based on their **image tensors** (i. e. the actual image content). This allows difPy to not only search for exact **duplicate images**, but also for **similar images** (which can be very useful if duplicate images have different file extensions, or if images are cropped versions of one another).
